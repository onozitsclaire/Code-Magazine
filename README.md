Practice HTML/CSS Website

This project is from Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS from Udemy.

Section 2: HTML Fundamentals

In this part of the project, I created an HTML website using various tags. Some of the different things I learned are:

- creating boilerplates at the beginning of HTML documents
- creating <body> tags
- <p> and <br> tags to create space and organization within a document
- the six different header tags <h1> thru <h6>
- <strong> and <em> tags, and how they have changed in HTML5 from <b> and <i> because of the semantic rules
- creating hyperlinks within the project folder itself and externally
- inserting images, and adjusting the images sizes
- creating forms
- creating buttons
- separating parts of code into chunks known as 'blocks' which will be important for CSS styling purposes

I'm sure I'm forgetting certain things, but this was a big chunk of what we learned. We created a sample website of a Coding Magazine, and also used an external website to practice on called CodePen.

Section 3: CSS Fundamentals

In this part of the project, I am adding to the previously created HTML website, CSS styling elements. Some of the different things I learned are:

- the difference between inline, internal and external CSS, and why external CSS is best practice for web development (especially with large projects)
- how to style HTML text with CSS
